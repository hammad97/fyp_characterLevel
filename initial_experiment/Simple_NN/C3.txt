I have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having
 osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his
 illness is the rare Gaucher's disease. 

Gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 
 inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal
 bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). The problem (in Type 1) is
 attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
 enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.
 This will eventually cause death.

Enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
 approved by the FDA in the last few years so that those patients
 administered with this drug (called Ceredase) report a remarkable
 improvement in their condition. Ceredase, which is manufactured
 by biotech biggy company--Genzyme--costs the patient $380,000
 per year. Gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most
 expensive disease in the world".

NEED INFO:
I have researched Gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
 on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:
**news, stories, reports
**people you know with this disease
**ideas, articles about Genzyme Corp, how to get a hold of
   enough money to buy some, programs available to help with
   costs.
**Basically ANY HELP YOU CAN OFFER

Thanks so very much!

Close. My mother comes from Gainesville Tex, right across the border.
They claim to be the chigger capitol of the world, and I believe them.
When I grew up in Fort Worth it was bad enough, but in Gainesville
in the summer an attack was guaranteed.

                             AND POLITICAL EXPO

                   THE MARRIOTT HOTEL AND THE SALT PALACE
                            SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH

Institute, and Political Expo are at the Salt Palace; breakfasts, parties, and
banquet are at the Marriott Hotel.

Marriott Hotel room rates are $79.00 night, plus 10.5% tax ($87.17 total). 
This rate is good for one to four persons room occupancy.  Double is one
or two beds; 3 or 4 people is 2 beds.  You can make your reservations
direct with the hotel (801-531-0800), or you can purchase your room
through one of MGP's payment plans.  MGP will provide assistance in
matching roommates if requested.

                                  Didn't Know Where to Ask!

Three days of intensive campaign training conducted by Sal Guzzetta, a
25 year veteran of more than 200 campaigns.  Students receive 990 pages
of professional campaign manuals.  Everything from strategy and
targeting to opposition research, fundraising, and field operations.

Price:           $150 if purchased by May 1, 1993

August 31 and Sept. 1:            Platform, Bylaws, Credentials and
                                  National committee meetings.

Shoot out in Salt Lake!  PLEDGE versus Committee for a Libertarian
Majority.  Will the party's membership and platform definitions change? 
Is compromise possible?  The Platform and Bylaws committees are
responsible for making recommendations to the convention concerning
changes in those documents.  At this convention, the party will only
consider deletions to the platform.  The Convention Rules would have to
be amended by a 2/3 vote to change this rule.

The meetings are open to the public.  There is no charge for attending.

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in
humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and
cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.
Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:
my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-
grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife
had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-
grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous
farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of
childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,
contain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and
baby, May 6, 1853."

>You wanted

More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have
direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.

>and now you want
>all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal

It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of
reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.

Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine
design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.

My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack
in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.

We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although
I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked
them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.
I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly
indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting
until an emergency to give in.

And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.
We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main
decisions were really hers.

I don't know of very many home birth advocates, even, that think that
a first-time mother should have her baby at home.

But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was
unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.
In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings
have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem
all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious
permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,
an esthetic consideration.

I sometimes see OTC preparations for muscle aches/back aches that
combine aspirin with a diuretic. The idea seems to be to reduce
inflammation by getting rid of fluid. Does this actually work?

You became older and your intestine normalized to the weaned state.  That
is, lactose tolerance is an unusual state for adults of most mammals
except for h. sapiens of northern European origin.  As a h. sapiens of 
asian descent (assumption based on name) the loss of lactase is normal
for you.

How long does it take a smoker's lungs to clear of the tar after quitting? 
Does your chances of getting lung cancer decrease quickly or does it take
a considerable amount of time for that to happen?

Gee, what do I do?  My LDL is only 50-60. (and my HDL is only 23-25)
I must be risking something, but Is it the same risk as those with 
very high LDL?

What about exercise and a low-fat diet?  What are the long-term 
effects of this drug?

Larry:

The subject content IS serious; as is the question.

On one hand you state that "things have changed dramatically" but, at the
same time nothing you "can think of has changed".  Your girlfriend seems
to want to see a counselor, but you don't.  

I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It's
a very good environment to examine issues.  

The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception than
you.  The TWO of you need to address the issue in order to resolve it.

Please consider going to a counselor with your girlfriend.  What could it
possibly hurt?

I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say
what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say
how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for
months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are 
every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.
Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug
in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics
about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of 
disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it
is worth.  

I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good 
patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and
Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637

Best of Luck to you.
